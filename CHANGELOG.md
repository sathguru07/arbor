## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-07

### Added

- **World Edges (Cross-File Resolution)** - Implemented `SymbolTable` and FQN-based linking for robust cross-file references.
- **Persistence Layer** - Integrated `sled` database for local graph storage (`GraphStore`).
- **ArborQL (MCP)** - Added `find_path` tool for finding shortest paths between nodes.
- **C# language support** - Methods, classes, interfaces, structs, constructors, properties
- **Control Flow edges** - `FlowsTo` edge kind for CFG (Control Flow Graph) analysis
- **Data Flow edges** - `DataDependency` edge kind for DFA (Data Flow Analysis)
- **Barnes-Hut QuadTree** - O(n log n) force simulation for visualizer scalability
- **Viewport culling** - Only render visible nodes/edges for 100k+ node support
- **LOD rendering** - Simplified node rendering at low zoom levels
- **Headless mode** - `--headless` CLI flag for remote/Docker/WSL deployment
- **Binary serialization** - `bincode` dependency for future binary wire protocol
